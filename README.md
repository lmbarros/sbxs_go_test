Testing utilities in Go.

I should probably be using something like
[Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify), but since I am just beginning
with Go, I thought it was too early to chose and rely on a third-party library
for my humble testing needs. Furthermore, writing this is also a learning
exercise.

That said, credits where credits are due: I learned quite a bit looking at
Testify's code, and its influence can be seen in my code. And I actually tried
to make my assertions have signatures close to those in Testify, so that I can
easily migrate if I ever feel like doing this.
